# ssg

This is a spartan static site generator and so should your needs be.
It has one useful function, `render-pages` that takes an output directory 
(as a string) and a map of filenames (as strings) to hiccup data. That
data is render into html and put in the requested filenames relative to
output-dir.

## Usage

Put this in your project.clj:

```clj
[com.emidln/ssg "0.1.0"]
```

and then use it like this:

```clj
(require 'ssg.core)
(ssg.core/render-pages "example/output/" 
         {"index.html" [:html [:body [:h1 "Hello World"]]]
          "page2.html" [:p "incomplete fragment on page 2"]})
```
